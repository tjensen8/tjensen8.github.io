## **Experience**

### *Data Science*
> The right tool for the right job built with best understanding.

Taylor has experience in many data science application spaces including:

- Deep Learning 
  - Feed-forward Neural Networks
  - Convolutional Neural Networks
  - LSTM & GRE Networks
  - And more.
- Forecasting
- Semantic Image Segmentation
- Object Detection
- Simulation
- Optimization
- Segmentation
- Linquistic Modeling

### *Technology*
> The complexity of the solution must match the complexity of the problem.


Taylor has experience in developing, implementing, and managing a diverse set of business systems and processes. Taylor has the mantra that the complexity of a problem must be matched by a system of equal complexity. This complexity includes both the complexity of the problems that are being answered today, and possible questions that could be asked in the future. 

These technology platforms include:

- AWS
- Salesforce
  - Managed and developed global procurement instance
- Streamlit
- Microsoft PowerBI
- Microsoft SQL Server
- Tableau
- SAP
- Manufacturing Systems: AspenTech, SEEQ, OSI PI

### *Business*
> Discrete value is developed through solutions that are built on an understanding of business decisions, continuous feedback from constituents, and iterative development. 

Taylor has a diverse background that spans multiple ares of business including operations, finance, business development/strategy, supply chain, and procurement. His background in various aspects of business coupled with a design thinking inspired approach to problem solving allows him to be an effective solutions partner. In addition, the full understanding of a problem and its impact to the business allows him to fully enroll business stakeholders in a solution. This results in increased interaction with solutions after initial rollout. This methodology also remains the same with management of third-party projects and solutions.
